Moving_Average

Colin's moving average files

So basically this program just takes in an array and averages the first x 
amount of numbers (determined by user) in the array. It then stores the average into a different 
array. It then goes to the next x amount of numbers and does it again.  It does this until all the
numbers have been averaged.
